# A1-Farmer
Gemcraft Frostborn Wrath Field A1 talisman farming macro

This script is provided on an AS-IS BASIS. Expect no future updates or support, I hacked it together for 
myself and am posting it on request. Basic knowledge of AHK may be required to get the most (or any) benefit.

TO USE:

	1. Install the latest version of AutoHotKey (AHK)from https://www.autohotkey.com/
	2. Doubleclcick the script to start it up
	3. "Center" field A1 by entering A1 on endurance and then quiting. DO NOT MOVE THE MAP AFTER THIS, if you do
		it will need to be recentered before the bot works.
	4. Press Ctrl+R to run
	
	Tips: 
	Press the ESC key to kill the script at any time if it wigs out on you.
	
	Default settings can be modified in the top section of the script using notepad
	
	Make sure you have space for new talismans, this script doesn't do any talisman processing. 
	You will have to manually sell the ones you don't want to maintain space.
	
	The script was written for monitor resolution 1920x1080 with the game running full screen. 
	Any deviation from this will probably not work correctly unless you modify the 
	coordinates in the script with your own coordinates. You can do this by using the Window Spy 
	utility included with AHK.
	
	Skill setup for the default script is based around 105 skill points in mana, 100 skill points in 
	true colors, traps and amplifiers, 70 skill points in fusion and crit hit, 50 in resonance and 30 in lanterns. 
	These numbers are total points and include talisman bonuses. Other skills shouldn't matter to the default setup.
